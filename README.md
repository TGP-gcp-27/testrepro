So this is the first time I'm really starting to work seriously with github.
A small step for mankind but a big step for me.
I hope that working with github or other version controll systems will 
bie seconde nature to me in the period of six months at maximum.
But how dow the Chinese say: A journey of thousand miles starts with the first step. So Welcome Github in my lift!
